        "We have talked about different data types, how to use them, and the kinds of operations that we can perform on them. We have also talked about using Booleans (`True` or `False`) to inform decisions in our programming. Often when we want to implement a decision in our code, we'll use conditionals. Conditionals allow us to break up our code in a way that we can selectively perform operations like assigning a value or even just printing text.\n",

We then saw how we can use the `else` statement to only run code when the conditional argument is `False` or falsy, and as we know, code that is not in a conditional block is still run as normal. Next, we examined what is truthy or falsy, and saw that None, 0, empty strings, and lists are all falsy. If we are unsure, we can use the `bool` function to see the boolean equivalent of a piece of data. Finally, we used `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements together to make decisions based on the conditions of our problem."
